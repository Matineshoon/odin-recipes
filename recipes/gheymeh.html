            <li>3 cups water
            </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon saffron, ground in a glass or porcelain mortar and pestle 
            </li>
            <li>3 limoo omani (Persian dried limes), pierced and steeped in hot water for 10-15 minutes 
            </li>
            <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon 
            </li>
            <li>¾ cup yellow split peas
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add in the onions and garlic and cook, stirring often, until fragrant. Add in the salt and turmeric. Mix in the tomato paste and allow the mixture to cook down for 3-5 minutes.

            </li>
            <li>Add in the meat and stir to combine. Do not allow the meat to brown.

            </li>
            <li>Add the water and black pepper. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Once the water reaches a boil, reduce to low and simmer, covered, for 1 hour.

            </li> 
            <li>After one hour, add in 2 more cups of water, drained limoo omani, saffron, cinnamon and split peas. Stir gently to ensure that nothing is sticking to the bottom of your pot. Cook covered for 1 hour on low heat.

            </li>
            <li>Check occasionally to ensure that the stew is saucy and not too dry. If needed, add ¼ cup of water at a time. Once the split peas are tender, your khoresh is ready.

            </li>
            <li>Remove the limoo omani and serve hot with rice tahdig.

            </li>
        </ol>
